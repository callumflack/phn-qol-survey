The PHN Quality of Life Survey is an **Express-based web application** developed for Pharmacy Health Networks Queensland, allowing patients to submit a specialised version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) survey online.

It has been **developed for ease-of-use and availability**, with support for various device types using **responsive HTML/CSS** technologies. This application is designed to be **hosted in a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) environment**, with a **publically-accessible** URL.

## Architecture
This application is built using **[Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) for data storage** and retrieval, along with **[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for view management** on the client-side.
